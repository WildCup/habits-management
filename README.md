# habits-management

This app is not made to create new habits but to change existing ones.
The first step to change any subconscious habit is to become aware of it. And the best way to achieve it is through notes.
Habits can be extremely complicated and this app is made to manage your notes easily and to visually display what you're working on.

Write down your notes :

- when,
- what happened,
- what did you feel,
- what do you want to do,
- what do you choose to do instead (change your habit),
- did it satisfy you

When you see the pattern connect your notes to habits :

- trigger of the habit,
- description,
- action,
- reward,

Work on you habits constantly choosing a new behaviour, until it becomes your new habit
